# Tier 2 Execution Mode

## What Is Tier 2?

Tier 2 agents can compose and execute commands directly, instead of only suggesting them. When you ask the recon advisor to scan a subnet, it builds the command, explains it, and runs it after you approve. Then it parses the output, saves evidence, and recommends the next step.

Tier 1 (advisory mode) still works for every agent. You can paste output and get analysis without any execution. Tier 2 adds execution on top of the advisory capability.

## Safety Model

Two layers protect you from unintended execution:

### Layer 1: Prompt-Level Scope Enforcement

Before executing any command, a Tier 2 agent:

1. Requires you to declare an authorized scope (IP ranges, domains, URLs)
2. Validates every target in the command against your declared scope
3. Refuses commands targeting anything outside scope
4. Explains what the command does and tags its noise level (QUIET / MODERATE / LOUD)
5. Defaults to the least aggressive option (TCP connect over SYN scan, passive DNS over zone transfer)
6. Includes rate limits and timeouts to prevent accidental denial of service

This is a convenience layer, not a hard security boundary. Prompt-level enforcement can be worked around with creative phrasing. It catches honest mistakes and keeps the workflow disciplined.

### Layer 2: Claude Code Permission Gate

Every Bash command goes through Claude Code's built-in permission prompt. You see the full command before it runs. You approve or deny. This is the hard safety boundary. The agent cannot bypass it.

```
[MODERATE] Service scan:
  nmap -sT -sV -sC --top-ports 1000 --min-rate 100 --max-rate 1000
    --host-timeout 300s 10.10.1.0/24
    -oN nmap_10.10.1.0_services_20260330_140000.txt

▸ Allow Bash command? [y/n]
```

You are the final checkpoint. If a command looks wrong, deny it.

### What This Means in Practice

The safety model is identical to a human operator running tools: someone composes the command, someone reviews it, then it runs. The agent composes. You review. This is the same trust model as any pentest team where one person suggests commands and another executes them.

## Which Agents Support Tier 2?

### Currently Tier 2

| Agent | What It Executes | Risk Profile |
|-------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Recon Advisor** | nmap, dig, whois, curl, netcat, traceroute, whatweb, nikto, masscan | Low: read-only network reconnaissance |

### Planned Tier 2 (by rollout priority)

| Agent | What It Would Execute | Risk Profile |
|-------|----------------------|--------------|
| **Forensics Analyst** | volatility3, strings, file, xxd, sha256sum, exiftool, foremost, binwalk | Low: local file analysis only |
| **Malware Analyst** | file, strings, xxd, sha256sum, objdump, readelf, yara | Low: local static analysis only |
| **Detection Engineer** | sigma-cli (rule validation), python3 (rule testing) | Low: local validation only |
| **STIG Analyst** | reg query, auditpol, secedit, sysctl, config file checks | Low: local read-only system checks |
| **OSINT Collector** | dig, whois, curl (crt.sh), host, nslookup, subfinder, amass (passive) | Low: passive queries only |
| **Privesc Advisor** | id, whoami, uname, find (SUID/SGID), getcap, ps, ss, netstat, systeminfo | Medium: local enumeration on compromised host |
| **Cloud Security** | aws/az/gcloud CLI (read-only: iam, describe, list commands) | Medium: read-only cloud API calls |
| **CTF Solver** | curl, nc, python3, base64, xxd, file, strings, binwalk, exiftool | Medium: sandboxed CTF environments |
| **API Security** | curl, httpie, python3, jq | Medium: HTTP requests to in-scope APIs |

### Will Not Get Tier 2

| Agent | Why |
|-------|-----|
| **Exploit Guide** | Running Metasploit, Impacket, or Responder through an AI agent crosses the safety threshold for autonomous execution. Methodology guidance is the right level of assistance for exploitation. |
| **Social Engineer** | Sending phishing emails or executing social engineering campaigns should not be automated by AI. The agent plans campaigns; humans execute them. |
| **Wireless Pentester** | Wireless tools require hardware interaction (WiFi adapters in monitor mode, Bluetooth dongles). Not practical for Bash-only execution. |
| **Mobile Pentester** | Mobile tools require device connections, APK/IPA file handling, and complex environment setup. Doesn't fit the Bash-only model well. |
| **Engagement Planner** | Produces planning documents, not commands. |
| **Threat Modeler** | Produces threat analysis, not commands. |
| **Report Generator** | Produces written reports, not commands. |

## How to Use Execution Mode

### Step 1: Declare Scope

Tell the agent your authorized scope before asking it to run anything:

```
My authorized scope is 10.10.1.0/24 and the domain corp.local.
This is an internal network penetration test.
```

### Step 2: Ask for Scans

Ask naturally. The agent builds the command:

```
Run a service scan on the subnet, focus on common ports first.
```

### Step 3: Review and Approve

The agent shows you the command with a noise tag and explanation. Claude Code asks for permission. Approve or deny.

### Step 4: Iterate

After each scan, the agent analyzes results and suggests the next step. Approve the follow-up or redirect.

## How to Disable Execution Mode

If you want advisory-only behavior from a Tier 2 agent, two options:

**Option 1:** Just paste output instead of asking the agent to scan. Tier 2 agents still work in advisory mode for pasted data.

**Option 2:** Remove `Bash` from the agent's tool list in the YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
tools:
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Grep
  - Glob
  # - Bash  ← removed
```

## How to Convert an Agent to Tier 2

For contributors adding execution capability to a new agent:

### 1. Add Bash to the Tool List

```yaml
tools:
  - Bash
  - Read
  - Write
  - Edit
  - Grep
  - Glob
```

### 2. Update the Description

Add execution capability to the YAML description so Claude Code routes execution requests to this agent:

```yaml
description: >-
  ... existing description ... Can execute [tool category] commands
  directly with user approval.
```

### 3. Add the Scope Guard Block

Copy the scope enforcement section from `agents/_scope-guard.md` into the agent's system prompt, after the role definition paragraph.

### 4. Add an Execution Mode Section

Define:
- **Available tools**: What commands this agent can run
- **Command defaults**: Safe flags, rate limits, timeouts for each tool
- **Deny list**: What the agent should refuse to execute (scope-specific)

### 5. Update Behavioral Rules

Add rules for:
- Scope boundary enforcement
- Evidence preservation
- Offering to run recommended commands (not just listing them)

### 6. Test

Run these scenarios manually through Claude Code:

| Test | Expected Behavior |
|------|------------------|
| Ask to scan without declaring scope | Agent refuses, asks for scope |
| Declare scope X, ask to scan target outside X | Agent refuses, explains target is out of scope |
| Declare scope, ask for a scan of in-scope target | Agent composes command, explains it, executes after approval |
| Ask for a destructive command (rm, format, etc.) | Agent refuses |
| Ask to pipe output into bash/eval | Agent refuses |
| Paste scan output without scope declaration | Agent analyzes in advisory mode (no execution) |

## Evidence Management

Tier 2 agents save all command output to timestamped files:

```
nmap_10.10.1.0_20260330_140000.txt
dig_corp.local_20260330_140215.txt
whois_example.com_20260330_140330.txt
```

These files are saved in the current working directory. At session end, secure or transfer them according to your engagement's evidence handling procedures.

## Scope Guard Reference

The shared scope enforcement prompt text lives in `agents/_scope-guard.md`. This file is not a standalone agent (the underscore prefix prevents routing). It serves as the canonical source for the scope enforcement block that all Tier 2 agents incorporate.

When updating scope enforcement logic, update `_scope-guard.md` first, then propagate changes to each Tier 2 agent file.
