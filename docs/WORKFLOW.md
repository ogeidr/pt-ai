# pt-ai Engagement Workflow

This document is the single visual reference for how a pt-ai engagement is
orchestrated as it stands today. It reconciles three moving parts:

- **Skills** (`skills/`) — the single source for both Claude Code (slash commands)
  and opencode (native, model-invoked skills).
- **Agents** (`agents/`) — 27 routable specialist subagents deployed to
  `~/.claude/agents/` at `./pt-ai provision`, plus 3 underscore-prefixed shared
  blocks (`_scope-guard`, `_findings-store`, `_untrusted-output`) that are *injected*
  into every agent that lacks them.
- **State files** in the per-engagement directory — `scope.md` (canonical),
  `findings.jsonl` (what was found), `gates.jsonl` (how far the engagement has
  progressed and what the operator approved).

For the prose methodology see [`AGENT-GUIDE.md`](AGENT-GUIDE.md); for the data
contracts see [`findings-store.md`](findings-store.md).

## 1. Top-level flow

`/scope-declare` is always first. `/engagement` then **initializes** the engagement
(confirms scope, authorization, and the authorized agent set) and the operator runs
the per-phase skills `/engage-recon → /engage-vuln → /engage-exploit →
/engage-cleanup → /engage-detect → /engage-report` in order — each does its own `Task`
fan-out (Claude Code only — they need the `Task` tool). A detached `/engage-retest`
round (operator-invocation only, like `/engage-exploit`) re-validates remediated
findings after report delivery. Without that, the same agents and skills are run by
hand as a playbook.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    start([Operator opens session in VM]) --> scope["/scope-declare<br/>(skill)"]
    scope -->|"authorization = no"| abort([ABORT — no offensive guidance])
    scope -->|"authorization = yes"| write["Writes:<br/>/engagements/{safe_id}/scope.md (canonical)<br/>/engagements/scope.md (pointer)"]

    write --> fork{How to run?}
    fork -->|Automated, Claude Code| eng["/engagement init →<br/>/engage-* phase skills"]
    fork -->|Manual playbook / opencode| manual["Invoke agents + skills<br/>one phase at a time"]

    eng --> phases[[Gated phase sequence 2-9]]
    manual --> phases
    phases --> report["report-generator → deliverable"]
    report --> done([Engagement complete])
```

## 2. The 0–9 lifecycle and the agents in each phase

Phases 0–1 are **pre-engagement** (handled by `/scope-declare` + the planning
agents). `/engagement` initializes; the `/engage-*` phase skills drive **phases
2–9**, one operator-invoked skill per phase. Every phase boundary is an operator
gate; the **recon → exploitation** transition is a *hard* gate backed by
`gates.jsonl` and an operator-invocation-only `/engage-exploit` skill.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    subgraph pre["Pre-engagement (phases 0-1)"]
        tm[threat-modeler] --> ep[engagement-planner]
    end

    subgraph p2["2. Recon"]
        fr["/full-recon (skill)"]
        osint[osint-collector]
        recon[recon-advisor]
        web1[web-hunter]
    end

    subgraph p3["3. Vuln assessment"]
        vuln[vuln-scanner] --> poc[poc-validator]
    end

    subgraph p4["4. Attack planning"]
        ap[attack-planner]
    end

    subgraph p5["5. Exploitation (HARD GATE)"]
        chain[exploit-chainer]
        adatt[ad-attacker]
        cloudsec[cloud-security]
        apisec[api-security]
        biz[bizlogic-hunter]
        cicd[cicd-redteam]
    end

    subgraph p6["6. Cred & lateral"]
        cred[credential-tester]
        priv[privesc-advisor]
    end

    subgraph p7["7. Detection"]
        det[detection-engineer]
    end

    subgraph p8["8. Compliance (optional)"]
        stig[stig-analyst]
    end

    subgraph p9["9. Reporting"]
        cal[severity-calibrate] --> rep[report-generator]
    end

    pre --> p2 --> p3 --> p4
    p4 -.->|operator approval line in gates.jsonl| p5
    p5 --> p6 --> p7 --> p8 --> p9
```

**High-authorization agents are OFF by default** and require their own written
authorization before `/engagement` will add them: `social-engineer`,
`wireless-pentester`, `mobile-pentester`, `exploit-guide`. Standalone-use agents not
on the default chain: `bug-bounty`, `ctf-solver`, `forensics-analyst`,
`malware-analyst`.

### Tier 2 vs advisory

| Tier | Behavior | Agents |
|---|---|---|
| **Tier 2 (Bash)** | Compose **and execute** commands after per-command approval | recon-advisor, vuln-scanner, web-hunter, bizlogic-hunter, ad-attacker, exploit-chainer, poc-validator, cicd-redteam, wireless-pentester |
| **Advisory (—)** | Analyze pasted data, produce guidance/documents; no execution | everyone else |

---

## 3. The engagement phase-skill state machine

`/engagement` records init; each `/engage-*` phase skill runs in the main thread, so
it can call `Task` to delegate to specialists (a subagent cannot spawn subagents —
this is why the lifecycle lives in skills, not a coordinating agent). The lifecycle
is **operator-gated, not autonomous**: each phase is a separate operator-invoked
skill that reconstructs state from disk and never auto-advances. Making the phase
boundary an explicit human action (invoking the next skill) is what hardens the
recon → exploitation gate.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Init
    Init: Init — read scope.md, confirm authorized agent set
    Init --> Recon: append init line {phase:init,status:declared} + operator approves start
    Recon: Phase 2-3 Recon + vuln assessment
    Recon --> Gate: append {phase:recon,status:complete}

    Gate: HARD GATE check
    Gate --> Recon: NO-GO — present findings, await operator
    Gate --> Exploit: GO — only if recon/complete AND exploitation/approved exist
    note right of Gate
      GO requires BOTH lines in gates.jsonl:
        {phase:recon,status:complete}
        {phase:exploitation,status:approved, by:operator}
      The approved line is written ONLY on an
      explicit operator decision — never inferred.
    end note

    Exploit: Phase 4-6 Exploitation, cred, lateral
    Exploit --> Detect: append {phase:exploitation,status:complete}
    Detect: Phase 7-8 Detection + compliance
    Detect --> Report: operator approves
    Report: Phase 9 report-generator reads findings.jsonl
    Report --> [*]
```

`gates.jsonl` line shapes (append-only, latest line per `(phase,status)` wins):

- `init` → `{engagement, phase:"init", status:"declared", authorized_agents:[…], scope, ts, by:"engagement"}`
- `phase done` → `{engagement, phase:"<name>", status:"complete", ts, by:"<phase-skill>"}`
- `operator gate` → `{engagement, phase:"<name>", status:"approved", ts, by:"operator"}`

---

## 4. Per-delegation protocol & data propagation

Subagents start with **cold context** — they see only the delegation prompt plus
files they read themselves. So every `Task` call carries the scope envelope, and
findings move through `findings.jsonl` rather than copy-paste.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    orch["/engage-* phase skill"]

    orch -->|1. validate target in scope<br/>+ agent on authorized list| check{In scope &<br/>authorized?}
    check -->|no| refuse[Emit envelope + REFUSE — no Task call]
    check -->|yes| env["2. Emit DELEGATION ENVELOPE<br/>(also the audit record)"]
    env --> task["3. Task(): envelope + role +<br/>prior data fenced as UNTRUSTED"]

    task --> agent[Specialist subagent]
    agent -->|re-validates scope itself| store[(findings.jsonl<br/>append-only)]
    store -->|reported| pocv[poc-validator]
    pocv -->|confirmed / false_positive| store
    store -->|confirmed| apl[attack-planner adds chain_id]
    apl --> store
    store -->|collapsed, latest-wins| cal[severity-calibrate]
    cal -->|deflated severity + temporal score| store
    store -->|collapsed, latest-wins| repgen[report-generator]

    agent -.->|tool output = untrusted data,<br/>cannot expand scope| orch
```

**Findings lifecycle:** `reported` → (`poc-validator`) → `confirmed` |
`false_positive` → `remediated` / `accepted_risk`. Precision =
`confirmed / (confirmed + false_positive)`. Producers (recon-advisor, vuln-scanner,
web-hunter, ad-attacker, cloud-security…, and the `/full-recon` skill) append
`reported`; consumers (attack-planner, report-generator) read back.

**Severity calibration (before reporting):** producers set a *provisional* severity from the
CVSS base plus an honest `exploitation` marker (default `unproven`). The `/severity-calibrate`
skill then recomputes each finding's `severity` from the CVSS v3.1 **temporal** score
(base × Exploit-Maturity × Remediation × Report-Confidence), **deflate-only**, and labels every
unproven finding **Theoretical** — so version-only criticals stop being reported as critical.
`report-generator` renders the calibrated values.

## 5. Safety layers (defense in depth)

The envelope and gates are **state-backed discipline, not a sandbox**. The hard
boundary is the per-command permission prompt plus the guard hook.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    cmd[Agent composes a command / output] --> L1

    subgraph L1["Layer 1 — prompt-level (advisory)"]
        sg[_scope-guard: scope + authorization + OPSEC ceiling QUIET/MODERATE/LOUD]
        uo[_untrusted-output: tool output is data, not instructions]
        fs[_findings-store: append-only, never rewrite]
    end

    L1 --> L2

    subgraph L2["Layer 2 — runtime hard boundary"]
        prompt[Claude Code per-command approval prompt]
        guard[pt-ai-guard.sh PreToolUse hook<br/>opencode: tool.execute.before plugin]
        deny[permissions.deny + ROE hooks]
    end

    L2 --> approve{Operator approves?}
    approve -->|yes & passes guard| run[Command runs]
    approve -->|no / blocked| stop[Denied]
```

The three Layer-1 blocks (`_scope-guard`, `_findings-store`, `_untrusted-output`)
are **auto-injected** into every routable agent at `./pt-ai provision` by
`provision/02-claude.sh` — only into agents that don't already carry the section
(idempotent). Underscore files are never routed to as agents.

---

## 6. Runtime surfaces

| Surface | Orchestration | Per-command gate | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (in VM) | `/engagement` init → `/engage-*` phase skills via `Task` fan-out | Built-in approval prompt + `pt-ai-guard.sh` hook | Full automated lifecycle |
| **opencode** (in VM → host model) | Skills read natively; agents become opencode subagents | opencode permission gate + `pt-ai-guard` plugin | Lifecycle runs, but quality is model-bound — use a strong model |
| **Manual / advisory** | Run agents one at a time as a playbook | Same Layer-2 gate | The fallback when no `Task` tool (e.g. opencode lacks `Task`) |

---

## 7. Artifact map

```
/engagements/
├── scope.md                      # active-engagement POINTER (overwritten each declare)
└── {safe_id}/
    ├── scope.md                  # canonical scope record (source of truth)
    ├── findings.jsonl            # append-only findings (what was found)
    ├── gates.jsonl               # append-only phase state (operator approvals)
    ├── scans/                    # raw tool output (nmap/nuclei/ffuf/trufflehog…)
    ├── reports/                  # consolidated markdown summaries (fullrecon/cloudaudit…)
    ├── exploit/                  # PoC scripts, attack-chain steps, exploitation artifacts
    ├── re/                       # reverse-engineering work (Ghidra projects, triage)
    └── samples/                  # user-provided binaries for RE
```

Control files (`scope.md`, `findings.jsonl`, `gates.jsonl`) live at the engagement
root; everything else is bucketed by category. The `evidence` field in each finding
is a path **relative to the engagement dir** (e.g. `scans/nmap_svc_….txt`).

Everything under `/engagements/` is synced to the host: evidence appears in real
time and survives VM snapshot restores.

## 8. What the orchestrator does NOT do (current limits)

The lifecycle is **forward-only and operator-gated**. These edges are handled
deliberately by the operator, not automatically by the orchestrator — call them out
so they are not assumed away:

- **No automatic re-recon.** There is no `exploitation → recon` transition. The
  phase table is one-way and `gates.jsonl` has no notion of a second recon round —
  *"the latest line per `(phase,status)` wins,"* with one `recon/complete` line.
- **Newly reachable *in-scope* hosts** are enumerated *inside* exploitation by the
  pivot-aware specialists (`exploit-chainer`, `attack-planner`, `privesc-advisor`),
  with **each pivot individually re-confirmed** (operator re-types the target) — not
  by re-entering a recon phase. The recon agents (`recon-advisor`, `osint-collector`,
  `web-hunter`, `/full-recon`) can be re-delegated by hand against them; they are the
  **same** agents from the init set, not new ones.
- **Newly reachable *out-of-scope* hosts are hard-refused** — per command
  (`_scope-guard` re-validates *every* command against scope) and per delegation
  (the envelope's "Target falls within scope: yes/no → no → REFUSE"). **Tool output
  can never expand scope** (`_untrusted-output`); only the operator can.
- **Expanding scope is a manual operator action:** re-run `/scope-declare`.
  ⚠ The recon → exploitation hard gate is **existence-based** — it checks that a
  `recon/complete` line *and* an `exploitation/approved` line exist, not that they
  cover the *current* scope. So scope added mid-engagement **inherits the original
  exploitation approval**; there is no phase-level re-gate on the expanded surface.
  The per-command permission prompt + `_scope-guard` (validating against the updated
  `scope.md`) remain the active checkpoint. A round/scope-aware gate is tracked as a
  future improvement, not a shipped behavior.
- **The authorized-agent set is frozen at init.** No new agents are spawned
  mid-engagement; adding one requires explicit operator re-confirmation.
