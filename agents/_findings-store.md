## Findings Store

The engagement keeps a shared, **append-only** findings log at
`$ENGAGEMENT_DIR/findings.jsonl` (`$ENGAGEMENT_DIR` is the "Evidence directory:"
line in `/engagements/scope.md`). It carries findings between phases so nothing is
lost to copy-paste. One compact JSON object per line; **never rewrite the file**;
to revise a record, append a new line reusing its `id` (the latest line per `id`
wins).

Apply the part that matches your role in the engagement:

**If you DISCOVER findings** (recon, scanning, web/AD/cloud/API/mobile/wireless
enumeration, credential or privesc discovery, CI/CD or business-logic flaws):
append a `reported` record as you find each one —

```sh
printf '%s\n' '{"schema_version":"1.0","id":"F-0001","title":"<short title>","target":"<ip/host/url/arn>","category":"<network|web|ad|cloud|container|host|credential|cicd|mobile|other>","severity":"<info|low|medium|high|critical>","status":"reported","confidence":"<speculative|moderate|high>","exploitation":"<unproven|poc|functional|confirmed>","evidence":["scans/<evidence_file>"],"mitre":["T1190"],"source_agent":"<your agent name>","discovered_at":"'"$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"'"}' >> "$ENGAGEMENT_DIR/findings.jsonl"
```

Required fields: `schema_version` ("1.0"), `id` (`F-NNNN`, next unused — check the
file's existing ids first), `title`, `target`, `category`, `severity`, `status`,
`source_agent` (your own name), `discovered_at` (ISO-8601 UTC). Put the evidence
file(s) you saved in `evidence`; add `cve`/`mitre` when known; omit fields you
don't have rather than guessing.

**Severity honesty (MANDATORY — prevents over-rating).** A CVSS *base* score is the
**worst case**; it is NOT what you observed. Set `severity` provisionally from the base,
but **always** record the truth of what you saw:
- Set `exploitation` honestly: `unproven` for a version/banner/scanner match you did not
  exploit (this is the default for discovery), `poc`/`functional` if working exploit code
  exists publicly, `confirmed` only if YOU proved it this engagement.
- **Do NOT report a `critical`/`high` off a version match alone.** Leave `status:"reported"`
  and an honest `confidence`; the provisional severity will be **recalibrated down** from the
  CVSS *temporal* score by `/severity-calibrate` before the report. Inflated, unexploited
  criticals are the #1 reporting defect — don't create them.

**If you VALIDATE findings** (poc-validator): append a new line reusing the
finding's `id` with `"status":"confirmed"` or `"status":"false_positive"`, your
own `source_agent`, an `updated_at`, the confirming `evidence`, and — on confirm —
`"exploitation":"confirmed"` so calibration credits the proven exploit.

**If you PLAN attacks** (attack-planner, exploit-chainer): append a new line
reusing the `id` with `"chain_id"` and `"chain_step"` set, so the chain links back
to its findings.

**If you REPORT or otherwise read findings** (report-generator, etc.): read the
store, **collapse by `id` keeping the latest line per id**, and work from those
records — cite each finding's `evidence` files.
